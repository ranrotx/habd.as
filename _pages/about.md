I'm a career IT Professional living in Dallas, Texas. Overall, I have a broad background in enterprise IT as well as cloud computing. Currently, I work as a Enterprise Solutions Architect for [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/).

I am passionate about all things technology. When I'm not working to help some of the worlds' largest and most important customers migrate and manage workloads in the cloud, I also apply some of the same knowledge and principles to home IT management.

Outside of IT, I have come to appreciate the importance of staying physically active. [Crossfit](http://www.crossfit.com/) has become my main training regimine. The gains have allowed me to do things I would have once through unthinkable for myself like running a half marathon.
